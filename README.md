Power BI was employed to create interactive dashboards that visualize the insights derived from our data analysis. These dashboards provide a comprehensive view of:
- Revenue trends.
- Customer segmentation.
- Items' performances.

## Promotional Combo Deal Strategy
Based on the findings from our analysis and visualization, we propose a strategic promotional combo deal aimed at increasing profit for the next year. This combo deal is designed to:
